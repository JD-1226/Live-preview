# Live-preview

A lightweight web tool to instantly preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript changes **without saving**.
Ideal for experimenting with code snippets or testing layouts in real time.

---

## Features

* Live rendering of HTML, CSS, and JS as you type
* No need to save/reload—instant feedback
* Simple, minimal UI for maximum distraction-free coding
* Useful for testing, prototyping, or teaching
* Runs locally (browser + server stack)

---

### Prerequisites

* Python (≥ 3.6)
* Django (or whichever backend you use, per project)
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

---

## Usage

* Type or paste your HTML into the “HTML” pane
* Write CSS in the “CSS” pane
* Write JS in the “JavaScript” pane
* The preview pane updates instantly without having to press “save”
* Use it as a scratchpad for testing or prototyping front-end ideas

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements

* Add auto-formatting / prettify support
* Add syntax highlighting & error reporting
* Add theme options (light / dark)
* Support for external libraries (e.g. import CSS/JS)
* Export preview as a file snapshot
* Live collaboration (multiuser editing)

## Acknowledgments / Inspiration

This tool is inspired by in-browser code playgrounds like CodePen, JSFiddle, etc. The goal here is minimalism and ease of local use.
